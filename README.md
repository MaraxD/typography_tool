# Typography tool
This tool allows you to draw freely with your own input. Just write in some words/letters, press enter and start drawing. You can change the color of the letters, the font and the size of it, or you can just delete everything you've just drawn. The cool part starts when the 'I'm feeling lucky' button is pressed. 

This tool expands, augments, muddles, complicates, questions, analyzes, spoils, undermines, improves, accelerates, and alters the act of drawing, or so i think. Clone this repo and see it for yourself.
